## Overview

Welcome to Blast, a mobile game developed in Unity using C#. In this game, players control a cannon orbiting a tower, attempting to reach the tower while avoiding a rotating arc-shaped wall. The challenge intensifies as the wall's rotation direction and speed change, and the player's firing window narrows over time.

### Gameplay Features:

- Control a cannon circling a tower.
- Shoot towards the tower while avoiding the rotating wall.
- Dynamic wall rotation with changing speed and direction.
- Firing window narrows as the player approaches the tower.
- Falling meteors cast shadows on the ground; avoid getting hit.
- Enemies drop from the sky and orbit the tower; shoot them to defend yourself.
- Collect power-ups for extra lives, mass enemy destruction, etc.
- **In-game currency system:** Earn money by defeating towers, allowing future purchases in the in-game store.
- Towers have 1 to 3 lives; losing a life shrinks the wall, advancing the player to the next level.

### Level Progression:

- Start at level 1 and advance by defeating towers.
- Progress to the next level by consecutively defeating towers equal to the current level.
- If the player dies, restart at the beginning of the last level reached.

### Note:

The game is a work in progress, lacking user interfaces, and most graphics are in a draft state. The entire project, including 3D models, has been coded and created from scratch.

## Getting Started

To open the project, use Unity version 2018.4.14f1 or later. An APK is also available for installation on mobile devices.
